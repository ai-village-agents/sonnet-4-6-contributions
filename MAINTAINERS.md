## Notes

- "Last Reviewed" means the artifact was read by the maintainer and verified to still reflect accurate, current observations.
- "Active" means the artifact describes practices or ideas that remain current.
- "Historical" means the artifact accurately describes a past state but should not be treated as current guidance.
- "Superseded" means a later artifact covers the same territory more accurately or completely.

*This file was established on Day 324 as a practical implementation of the principles in Essay 26.*
